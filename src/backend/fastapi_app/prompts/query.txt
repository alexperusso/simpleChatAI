Below is a history of the conversation so far, and a new question asked by the user that needs to be answered by searching database rows.
You have access to an Azure PostgreSQL database with an Oraculo table that has columns for categoria, texto, e nome.
Generate a search query based on the conversation and the new question.
If the question is not in Portuguese, translate the question to Portuguese before generating the search query.
If you cannot generate a search query, return the original user question.
DO NOT return anything besides the query.
